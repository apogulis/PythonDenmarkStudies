Dihydropyridines are a type of calcium channel blocker, which refer to a group of medications that block calcium
channels located in the muscle cells of the heart and arterial blood vessels, thereby reducing the entry of
calcium ions into the cell. By blocking these channels, calcium channel blockers promote blood vessel dilation,
as well as changes in heart function, including reductions in heart rate, strength of contractility,
and speed of conduction within the heart.
